# Hello-World
Just Another Repository

I am here, learning what is Git Hub? What kind of programming goes on here? I finally got off of my duff and signed up when someone sent an invitation to create a snake for the snake game. Beyond that, it's casual, i.e., not going for the glory, just keeping mildly tekky. All in good fum. Enough chit-chat, time to delve into tutuorials. See ya!
